          <p>
            I am a final year B.Tech Computer Science student specializing in Cybersecurity @ Jain University. 
            Passionate about Cybersecurity, AI, and building real-world tech solutions.

          <p>
            Alongside tech, I also work as a part-time Realtor managing property listings and client deals. 
            This unique blend of technical expertise and real estate acumen allows me to approach problems 
            from both analytical and business perspectives.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            My journey in tech has been driven by a curiosity to understand how systems work and how to 
            protect them. I spend my time exploring cybersecurity concepts, developing defensive mechanisms, 
            and staying updated with the latest threats and vulnerabilities in the digital landscape.
